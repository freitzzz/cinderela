Don't get fooled by this repo, it's just a database of files (a lot of images) that I've pushed in order to use GitHub as my personal CDN.

Every file is uploaded remotely using [github-upsert cli tool](https://github.com/web-pacotes/github-upsert). You can get it via npx:

```bash
npx i @web-pacotes/github-upsert
```
